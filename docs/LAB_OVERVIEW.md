# Docker Testcontainers Lab Overview

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, TSEs will be able to:

1. **Understand Testcontainers Fundamentals**
   - Explain what Testcontainers is and why it's valuable
   - Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests
   - Recognize when to use Testcontainers vs mocks

2. **Set Up Testcontainers Environments**
   - Configure Testcontainers in multiple programming languages
   - Set up Testcontainers Cloud for scalable testing
   - Manage container lifecycle and resources

3. **Write Integration Tests**
   - Create tests with real databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
   - Test message queues and streaming services (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
   - Test web services and APIs with Testcontainers

4. **Debug and Troubleshoot**
   - Identify common Testcontainers issues
   - Use debugging techniques for containerized tests
   - Optimize test performance and resource usage

5. **Apply Best Practices**
   - Implement proper test isolation
   - Use container reuse strategies
   - Handle test data and cleanup
